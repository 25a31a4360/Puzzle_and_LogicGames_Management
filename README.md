# 🧠 Logic Puzzle & Mathematical Utility Suite
A comprehensive, console-based collection of interactive logic puzzles and numerical utilities written in C. This project is designed as a first-year academic project for building foundational algorithmic logic.
---
# ✨ Highlights
* **Clean, simple interface** — ideal for learning and demoing C fundamentals.
* **Instant logic validation** — immediate feedback for mathematical checks and sliding puzzles.
* **Easy to extend** — simple to add new mathematical theories, game levels, or difficulty modes.
---
# 🎯 Features
* **Magic Number Check:** Identifies if the recursive sum of a number's digits equals 1.
* **Palindrome Check:** Verifies if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.
* **Digit Frequency:** Analyzes and counts the occurrence of each digit (0-9) in an input.
* **Mathematical Quiz:** Generates random arithmetic problems for real-time testing.
* **Continuous Pattern:** Displays geometric or numerical shapes using nested loop logic.
* **15-Puzzle (Logic):** A sliding tile game where users arrange numbers in a 4x4 grid.
* **Sequence Solver:** Predicts and solves the next numbers in a logical series.
* **Decimal to Binary:** A conversion utility for base-10 to base-2 transformations.
